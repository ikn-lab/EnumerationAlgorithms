# Implemetations 
n: the number of vertices, m: the number of edges. 

- <font face="'Impact','Century Gothic','Computer Modern Typewriter'">OSedge</font>: 
	- Outputs: All subgraphs with girth k. 
	- Complexity: amortized O(Poly(n)) time and O(Poly(n)) space. 
- edge: 
	- Outputs: All subgraphs with girth k. 
	- Complexity: amortized O(n) time and O(n^3) space. 
- induced:  
	- Outputs: All induced subgraphs with girth k. 
	- Complexity: amortized O(n) time and O(n^3) space. 
- inducedSlow:  
	- Outputs: All induced subgraphs with girth k. 
	- Complexity: amortized O(n) time and O(n^3) space. 
	- $\textbf{Note}$: The time and space complexity is same as induced. However, this implementation has large constant factor than induced. 
- naive_edge:

	- Complexity: O(2^m m) total time and O(n + m) space. 
- naive_induced}: 
	- Outputs: All induced subgraphs with girth k
	- Complexity: O(2^n m) total time and O(n + m) space.
